<h1 align="center">Customer Analysis in Credit Card</h1>
Credit card usage behavior data is a valuable resource for companies seeking to optimize their marketing strategies. By understanding the patterns of behavior exhibited by credit card users, companies can tailor their marketing efforts to target specific groups of users more effectively. However, working with such data can present several challenges, including data quality issues, missing values, and the need to identify meaningful patterns within the data. Our goal is to group users based on their behavior in order to develop an effective and efficient credit card marketing strategy.</br>

<h3>About the dataset</h3>
In this project, we will work with a dataset containing the credit card usage behavior of around 9000 users over a six-month period. We will explore the data, preprocess it, and apply clustering algorithms to segment the customers into different groups based on their usage behavior.The dataset is taken from:-

<h3>Objective</h3>
This notebook aims to:
</br>
1.Perform dataset exploration using various types of data visualization.
</br>
2.Perform data preprocessing before using models.
</br>
3.Grouping customers into clusters using various clustering models.
</br>
4.Perform interpretation and analysis of the groups (profiling) that have been created.
</br>
5.Provide marketing suggestions based on profiling results and analysis conducted.
</br>
</br>

<h3>Clustering Models</h3>
The clustering models used in this notebook are:
</br>
1.Partition based (K-Means),
</br>
2.Density based (DBSCAN), and
</br>
3.Hierarchical Clustering (Agglomerative).
</br>
</br>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
In conclusion, understanding credit card usage behavior data is crucial for companies seeking to optimize their marketing strategies. By clustering customers based on their usage behavior, companies can tailor their marketing efforts to target specific groups of users more effectively. In this project, we explored a dataset containing the credit card usage behavior of around 9000 users over a six-month period. We applied various clustering algorithms, including K-Means, DBSCAN, and Agglomerative, to segment the customers into different groups based on their usage behavior.
</br>
</br>
After profiling and analyzing the groups, we provided marketing suggestions based on the results. For instance, we suggested that banks can target customers in cluster 1, who are active credit card users, with benefits or rewards to encourage more frequent usage of credit cards. For customers in cluster 3, who use credit cards specifically for installment purposes, banks can offer installment programs with low or 0% interest to attract more customers. Furthermore, banks can offer entry-level credit cards with special features for customers in cluster 2, who are students or new users. Lastly, for customers in cluster 4, who tend to make cash advances, banks can offer special credit cards with various benefits, such as low or no cash advance or admin fees.

Overall, the insights gained from this project can help companies develop an effective and efficient credit card marketing strategy that caters to the needs and preferences of different customer segments.
